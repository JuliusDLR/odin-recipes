        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Turkey Bacon</li>
            <li>2 Whole Eggs</li>
            <li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a pan over medium heat, once hot use cooking spray and add turkey bacon.</li>
            <li>Cook bacon for around 5 mins then flip and repeat until browned & crispy.</li>
            <li>Put bacon on paper towels then add 2 eggs to the pan and cook until somewhat solid.</li>
            <li>Once slightly solid add your cheese on top of it and allow it to melt at the same time your eggs are cooking.</li>
            <li>Here you have 2 options, 
                OPTION 1) Either toast bread in a toaster or OPTION 2) toast your bread in that pan we been using. For this recipe we'll assume its the latter.</li>
            <li>Throw a slice of bread in the pan and move your eggs & cheese onto the slice.</li>
            <li>Then add the bacon as well as any sauces you want and finish with the other slice.</li>
            <li>Squish the sandwich and flip until bread is properly toasted.</li>
            <li>Cut your sandwich anyway you like and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
