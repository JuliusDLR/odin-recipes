My current project is a recipes website that will display
the HTML skills Ive acquired so far. 

My goals are to create 11 pages in total, a homepage, choices page and meal pages for each meal. I estimate the challenging part coming later with CSS and JavaScript. As of right now I dont see anything that would be a complication with just HTML atm.
